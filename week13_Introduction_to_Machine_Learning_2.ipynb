    "**Regularization** is a crucial technique in machine learning that helps prevent **overfitting**. When developing machine learning models, we often encounter situations where the training accuracy is high, but the validation or testing accuracy remains low. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too specialized in the training data, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise present in the data. Regularization aims to strike a balance by fitting the model appropriately on the training set while avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore some common regularization techniques and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lasso Regularization (L1 Regularization)**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Lasso adds the \"absolute value of magnitude\" of the coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     - The penalty term encourages the model to shrink the coefficients toward zero.\n",
    "     - Some coefficients may become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**:\n",
    "     - Lasso is useful when we suspect that some features are irrelevant or redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ridge Regularization (L2 Regularization)**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Ridge adds the \"squared magnitude\" of the coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     - The penalty term discourages large coefficients.\n",
    "     - Coefficients are shrunk but not set to zero.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**:\n",
    "     - Ridge is effective when dealing with multicollinearity (highly correlated features).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net Regularization**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     - It balances the strengths of Lasso and Ridge.\n",
    "     - Encourages sparsity (some coefficients become zero) while also handling correlated features.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**:\n",
    "     - Useful when dealing with datasets containing many features and potential collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regularized Model to Avoid Underfitting and Overfitting**:\n",
    "   - Regularization helps find an optimal trade-off between bias and variance.\n",
    "   - By penalizing complexity, it prevents overfitting (high variance) and underfitting (high bias).\n",
    "   - Adjusting the regularization hyperparameter allows fine-tuning the model.\n"
