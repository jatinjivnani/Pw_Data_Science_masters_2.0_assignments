    "Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that performs both variable selection and regularization. Lasso Regression is similar to Ridge Regression in that it adds a penalty term to the cost function, but it differs in that it uses the L1 norm of the coefficients instead of the L2 norm used in Ridge Regression. The L1 norm encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, which means that it tends to set some of the coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Lasso Regression has the advantage of producing a more interpretable model by setting some coefficients to zero and selecting only the most important features. This can be particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many features. In contrast, other regression techniques, such as OLS regression, do not perform variable selection and may result in overfitting when dealing with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Lasso Regression has the advantage of being more robust to outliers compared to other regression techniques, as the L1 norm is less sensitive to outliers compared to the L2 norm used in Ridge Regression. However, Lasso Regression may not perform as well as Ridge Regression in situations where many features are highly correlated with each other, as it tends to select only one of the correlated features and ignore the others.\n",

    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it automatically selects the most important features and sets the coefficients of the less important features to zero.

The sparsity property of Lasso Regression allows it to perform feature selection, effectively reducing the number of features used in the model and preventing overfitting.\n",

    "Compared to other feature selection methods, such as backward or forward selection, Lasso Regression does not require a priori knowledge of which features are important, as it determines the importance of features based on their contribution to the prediction error.

A larger value of alpha results in a more pronounced penalty on the size of the coefficients, leading to a sparser coefficient vector and more aggressive feature selection. On the other hand, a smaller value of alpha results in a less pronounced penalty, leading to a less sparse coefficient vector and potentially more features being included in the model.\n",

In such cases, Lasso Regression may arbitrarily select one of the correlated features and set the others to zero, leading to unstable and inconsistent solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one way to mitigate the effects of multicollinearity in Lasso Regression is to use an alternative regularization technique called Elastic Net Regression. Elastic Net Regression combines the L1 penalty of Lasso Regression with the L2 penalty of Ridge Regression, allowing it to handle both feature selection and multicollinearity simultaneously. The Elastic Net penalty is controlled by two hyperparameters, alpha and l1_ratio, which control the relative weight of the L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
