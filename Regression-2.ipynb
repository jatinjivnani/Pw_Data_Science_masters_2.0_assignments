    "**R-squared** (also known as the **coefficient of determination**) is a crucial metric in **linear regression** models. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - R-squared measures how well a linear regression model **fits** the data.\n",
    "   - It quantifies the **proportion of variance** in the **dependent variable** (response) that can be **explained by the predictor variable(s)** (independent variable(s)).\n",
    "   - R-squared values range from **0 to 100%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **0%**: A model that **does not explain any variation** in the response variable around its mean. Essentially, the mean of the dependent variable predicts as well as the regression model.\n",
    "   - **100%**: A model that **perfectly explains all the variation** in the response variable around its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculation**:\n",
    "   - R-squared is calculated as follows:\n",
    "     - Let \\(SS_{\\text{total}}\\) be the **total sum of squares** (variation in the dependent variable around its mean).\n",
    "     - Let \\(SS_{\\text{residual}}\\) be the **sum of squared residuals** (variation unexplained by the regression model).\n",
    "     - R-squared (\\(R^2\\)) is given by: $$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{\\text{residual}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Meaning**:\n",
    "   - A higher R-squared indicates that the model explains a larger proportion of the variation in the response variable.\n",
    "   - However, **high R-squared does not guarantee a good model**. It's essential to consider other factors (e.g., residual plots, domain knowledge).\n",

    "1. **R-squared (R²):**\n",
    "   - R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (target) explained by the independent variables (features) in a regression model.\n",
    "   - It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model doesn't explain any variability, and 1 indicates that it explains all the variability.\n",
    "   - Higher R-squared values suggest a better fit, but it doesn't guarantee that the model is an excellent predictor in an absolute sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared:**\n",
    "   - Adjusted R-squared addresses a limitation of R-squared, especially in multiple regression models (with more than one independent variable).\n",
    "   - While R-squared tends to increase as more variables are added to the model (even if they don't significantly improve it), adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables.\n",
    "   - It considers the number of predictors in the model and adjusts R-squared accordingly.\n",
    "   - This adjustment helps avoid overfitting and provides a more accurate measure of the model's goodness of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison:**\n",
    "   - R-squared remains the same or increases when adding more predictors, even if they don't contribute meaningfully. This can give a falsely optimistic view of the model.\n",
    "   - Adjusted R-squared is more conservative and decreases if additional variables don't enhance the model's explanatory power¹²³. \n",

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in a regression model. While R-squared measures how well a model fits the data, adjusted R-squared adjusts for the potential inflation of R-squared due to adding more predictors. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R-squared (R²):** This metric quantifies the proportion of variance in the response variable explained by the predictor variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no explanatory power, and 1 indicates perfect fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared:** It's calculated as follows:\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Adjusted R}^2 = 1 - \\left(1 - R^2\\right) \\cdot \\frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} \\]\n",
    "   - \\(R^2\\) is the regular R-squared.\n",
    "   - \\(n\\) represents the number of observations.\n",
    "   - \\(k\\) represents the number of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages of Adjusted R-squared:**\n",
    "   - Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant predictors. If a new predictor doesn't significantly improve the model, the adjusted R-squared won't increase much.\n",
    "   - It allows comparison of models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have two regression models:\n",
    "1. Model with hours spent studying and current grade:  \n",
    "   - R-squared: 0.955\n",
    "   - Adjusted R-squared: 0.946\n",
    "2. Model with an additional predictor (shoe size):\n",
    "   - R-squared: 0.965\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the adjusted R-squared helps us assess whether adding shoe size as a predictor is worthwhile. If the adjusted R-squared decreases, it suggests that shoe size doesn't contribute significantly to explaining the variation in the response variable.\n"
