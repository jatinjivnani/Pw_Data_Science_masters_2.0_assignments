    "1. **Slope (Coefficient for the Independent Variable)**:\n",
    "   - The slope represents the change in the dependent variable (usually denoted as \\(y\\)) for a one-unit change in the independent variable (usually denoted as \\(x\\)).\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the slope (\\(a\\)) in the simple linear regression equation \\(y = a x + b + e\\) quantifies the rate of change in \\(y\\) with respect to changes in \\(x\\).\n",
    "   - Interpretation: For each unit increase in \\(x\\), the predicted value of \\(y\\) changes by the slope amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intercept (Constant Term)**:\n",
    "   - The intercept (\\(b\\)) is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.\n",
    "   - In practical terms, it represents the starting point of the regression line.\n",
    "   - Interpretation: When \\(x\\) is zero, the predicted value of \\(y\\) is equal to the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Suppose we're analyzing the relationship between study hours (\\(x\\)) and exam scores (\\(y\\)) for a group of students. We fit a simple linear regression model:\n",

    "   - **Definition**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used to train machine learning models by minimizing errors between predicted and actual results.\n",

    "   - **Procedure**:\n",

    "   - **Objective**: In regression analysis, we aim to isolate the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
