    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management. It serves as a repository for various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, and more.\n",
    "Databases are crucial for applications, websites, and systems to store and retrieve data reliably.\n",

    "SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. But from another side, it can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system. \n",

    "Relational Databases (RDBMS): SQL databases follow a relational model. They store data in tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "Language: SQL databases use SQL to define and manipulate data. SQL is powerful and versatile, making it suitable for complex queries.\n",
    "Structure: Data is organized into tables with rows and columns. All data must adhere to the same structure.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable (increasing resources on a single server).\n",
    "Properties: SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).\n",
    "Use Cases: Ideal for applications requiring multi-row transactions (e.g., accounting systems).\n",

    "\n",
    "**NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Schema: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema for unstructured data. They can store data in various ways (document-oriented, key-value pairs, graph-based, etc.).\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable (adding more servers). They handle large or dynamic datasets effectively.\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases donâ€™t rely on tables. Instead, they use different data models (e.g., documents, graphs).\n",
    "Properties: NoSQL databases follow the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance).\n",
    "Use Cases: Suitable for unstructured data (e.g., JSON documents) and applications with changing requirements."

    "**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) and an integral part of **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**. DDL commands are used to create, modify, or delete the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. Let's delve into each of these commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**:\n",
    "   - The CREATE command is employed to **create a new table** in SQL.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "         column_1 datatype,\n",
    "         column_2 datatype,\n",
    "         ...\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     Suppose we want to create a table called `Student_info` to store information about students in a college:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Student_info (\n",
    "         College_Id number(2),\n",
    "         College_name varchar(30),\n",
    "         Branch varchar(10)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ALTER**:\n",
    "   - The ALTER command allows us to **add, delete, or modify columns** in an existing table.\n",
    "   - Syntax to add a column:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     Let's add a new column for **CGPA** to our `Student_info` table:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     ALTER TABLE Student_info ADD CGPA number;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TRUNCATE**:\n",
    "   - The TRUNCATE command **deletes all rows** from a table while retaining its structure.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     Suppose the college authority wants to remove student details for new batches but keep the table structure intact:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     TRUNCATE TABLE Student_info;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DROP**:\n",
    "   - The DROP command is used to **remove an existing table along with its structure** from the database.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DROP TABLE table_name;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     If the college authority decides to delete the `Student_info` table entirely:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DROP TABLE Student_info;\n",

    "Data Manipulation Language (DML) is another subset of SQL that deals with the manipulation of data within a database. Let's explore the three primary DML commands:\n",

    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)\n",

    "     VALUES (101, 'Engineering College', 'Computer Science', 8.5);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE**:\n",
    "   - The `UPDATE` command modifies existing data in a table.\n",

    "     SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\n",

    "     UPDATE Student_info\n",
    "     SET CGPA = 9.0\n",
    "     WHERE College_Id = 101;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE**:\n",
    "   - The `DELETE` command removes specific rows from a table.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DELETE FROM table_name\n",
    "     WHERE condition;\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **SELECT**:\n",
